    <h3>Desription</h3>
    <p>This lemonade recipe is for real, authentic, vintage lemonadeâ€”the kind you might enjoy on a hot summer day at one of those stands at the state fair.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li>6 lemons</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>6 cups cold water</li>
     
    </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash lemons and peel off all the zest using a vegetable peeler; set peeled lemons aside. 
            Add lemon zest to a bowl and cover with sugar; toss to combine. 
            Cover and let sit for a minimum of 2 hours, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a pot over high heat; turn off heat and pour in lemon-sugar mixture. 
            Stir and let sit until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour through a mesh strainer back into the same bowl and discard the zest. 
            Let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut lemons in half and squeeze juice into the bowl. 
            Pour lemonade into a serving pitcher; cover and chill thoroughly before serving over ice, at least 2 hours.
        </li>    

    </ol>
